# Baseline Content Framework Proposal

### V1.0_18 June, 2021

## Purpose of this document
This document is meant to be a guideline for anyone developing communications, marketing, thought leadership and related types of non-technical content – for example,  marketing, project communications, educational or thought leadership content – for the Baseline project. It was developed after a communications needs analysis, which included review of current content and interviews with key project members, as well as review by members of the Outreach team. 

This framework is geared to messaging and is a subset of the overall Marketing and Outreach effort of the Baseline community. Other aspects of project communications – for instance PR, community outreach, social media or branding – are not directly in scope. For more see the [Comms and Marketing](https://ethereum-baseline.slack.com/archives/C011NCZ2ES1) and [Go To Market](https://ethereum-baseline.slack.com/archives/C01QJHP86UF) Slack channels.

At the time of writing, there is no formal communications, marketing or content-related governance for Baseline. This document is therefore meant simply as a recommendation for an initial roadmap and an outline of potential core content collateral. It contains among other things:

* An overview of the main content needs and pain points based on the analysis done in April and May 2021
* A content plan, consisting of a number of recommendations for key content that should be created ASAP:
     * These are linked to separate briefings, which provide more detail for anyone wishing to take on the task of preparing the content
* An outline of additional content the project could or should consider
* Thoughts on potential Baseline Communications and Marketing setup based on current project parameters

This framework and related documents were prepared by Tom Lyons under [Baseline / Ethereum Foundation Grant 3](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis/baseline-grants/issues/11). The author can be reached at lyonstom01@gmail.com. Delivered in June, 2021.

## Communication needs and pain points
During the course of the research for this framework we identified seven overarching comms needs or challenges project communications and marketing should look to address:

### Problem 1: Hard/confusing to onboard (how do I learn about Baseline?)

There is a need to streamline the onboarding process for non-technical audiences. To get a sense, here are some quotes from the interviews:

* “When I showed up I was told ‘here is the website, here is the Slack channel, everything you need to know is on that. And that wasn’t the case. There was information all over the place, and it hasn’t been vetted. On top of that you have all these meetings, gatherings, initiatives, you want to figure out where you can best fit in but not necessarily so easy.” 
* But from the same person:“Was thoroughly impressed with all the documentation and meetings and tools, thoroughly impressed. There is real potential here”
* “Like everyone so far, I had to brute force my way into understanding. I asked a lot of questions.”


Generally, the issue with Baseline is not that there isn’t enough material but rather too much. There is a clear need for ways to streamline the process of getting up to speed on the project, both in terms of what Baseline is and how (non-technical) people can contribute. 

### Problem 2: Problem statement isn’t clear enough (why should I care about Baseline?)

Interviewees said:

* “We do need to focus on the business conversation. …If you show up at Baseline today it is a technical conversation. It needs a business side and a regular website not attached to Github that starts explaining what the potential use cases are.”
* “The website is very good for providing the high level view of protocol and governance, then into more technical stuff, but nothing in between. Nothing that addresses the more business side, or those who don't know about blockchain.”
* “People don't read, they experience. So the website needs to be an experience. If  you want to reach executives, they need to get it at one glance. A 2-minute video that is right there, that looks awesome.”


There is a need in Baseline marketing and comms to articulate clear problem statements. We have tried to address this in the Key Messages recommendations, but anyone working on Baseline content is encouraged to look for ways to explain clearly and simply why baselining matters.

### Problem 3: Audiences (who are we speaking to?)

Along with focussing on the business discussion, there was a feeling that the project should be more clear on the business and user audiences (or personas) it should address. Some comments included:

* “When this journey first started the people who came to this community understood blockchain. Now it has grown beyond blockchain. Many people don't understand the tech or know the pitfalls of crypto.”
* “First ask, who do we want to talk to? The C-Suite etc are getting pitched on a whole bunch of things. Who else could we actually engage that would give us an insight into their normal processes and their waste and friction and all that?”


It would likely be beneficial to invest some time and effort in exploring the different target personas, agreeing on the most important, and defining the kinds of messages likely to resonate with each group. We have also tried to address this in the Key Messages recommendations.

### Problem 4: Not (crystal) clear how to talk about Baseline (what is Baseline?)

Interviews revealed differing definitions of what Baseline is, all of which have merit:

* “Baseline is a set of tools and standards on how to use blockchain technology to transform your business processes and operate on a blockchain.”
* “A new substrate for commerce”
* “Baseline allows for strictly deterministic business processes in zero knowledge”
* “With Baseline, you can virtually eliminate your back office reconciliation costs, reduce your cycle times to mere minutes, and maintain consistent recordkeeping in multiparty/counterparty workflows...all without sacrificing your security profile or data privacy compliance. Furthermore, you can do this with your existing systems of record and without a significant capital investment.”
* “In the baseline 
we are formalizing the existing best practices for business workflow modelling for multiple business and trading partners. By focusing on the workflow you take the emphasis away from the technology.” 
* “The Baseline Protocol is an open source initiative that combines advances in cryptography, messaging, and blockchain to deliver secure and private business processes at low cost via the public Ethereum Mainnet. The protocol will enable confidential and complex collaboration between enterprises without leaving any sensitive data on-chain.”

Here again, we have tried to address this issue in the  Key Messages recommendation below. Anyone working on Baseline content is encouraged to look for clear, concise ways to describe how Baseline works to people who a) don’t have a technical background, and b) don’t have a lot of time. A challenge for the project as a whole will be to align on the preferred way to do this.

### Problem 5: Plain language technical descriptions and ROI (how does Baseline work?)

Describing how Baseline technology works to a non-technical audience is another key challenge. There is a clear need for simple but correct explanations that address things like: 

* Plain language explanations of the tech (Baseline 101)
* Differentiators between Baseline and other approaches to the same problems
* Making it clear that this is a standard, a process description, and not a product
* To make it clear to those unfamiliar with open source projects how open source works
* To make Baseline’s benefits clear especially in terms of ROI/KPIs in business processes

The challenge here is to provide details about what is a sophisticated and complex technology in a simple way without oversimplifying and losing nuances. That said, the target audience, even on the business side, will likely be fairly tech-savvy.

### Problem 6: Community outreach (why should I contribute?)

The project wants to encourage contributors, but while there seems to be a healthy amount of interest in Baseline, attracting people to the project, getting effective engagement requires giving people a reason to commit their time and energy. Some of the challenges include:

* Outlining how companies can make money from Baseline (and providing examples of those that do)
* Making it clear how contributing to the standard/community now can open doors to opportunities later
* Making it clear what the pathways for contribution are (onboarding, governance)

Any and all content that can spread the word about why it makes sense to get involved will clearly be helpful. These reasons may be different in different regions, so having a region-specific approach may also make sense. 

### Problem 7: Comms and marketing resources and governance (who decides, who implements?)

Right now, communications and marketing is done on a purely volunteer basis, coordinated by the Outreach group. As in any volunteer-only setup, the volunteer approach to Baseline communications and marketing raises a number of challenges. These include:

* Levels of availability and levels of commitment fluctuate
* Unlike many software engineering challenges, where a specific outcome is defined, there is rarely one right answer for things like messaging, storytelling, presentations. Generally, someone at some point needs to decide on an angle and approach among a number of equally good possibilities and a variety of opinions on what is right.
* Operational communications for a project of Baseline’s size tends to require a full-time commitment if the project wants to be responsive to things like user requests, issues management, and the like.
* Similarly, the effort involved in effectively coordinating communications and marketing activities in a global community like Baseline is significant, though may not be immediately apparent.

## Content suggestions

### Core Content projects

To address the above needs, we recommend the project work on the following core set of comms and marketing collateral. All of the recommendations below are linked to briefings for anyone interested in implementing these. 

#### 1: Boilerplate, marketing key messages and personas
The project should agree on some basic messaging/marketing language and its target personas. This would not be distributed externally, but be used internally to inform any other basic messaging. We recommend the following:

* Boilerplate language
	   * Tagline
	   * 1 sentence
	   * 1 paragraph
	   * 1 page
* Detailed Key Messages
* Audience/persona profiles

Draft boilerplate text as well as a detailed briefing and first set of bullets around the messaging has already been started. The task here is to build on that to finish the document and then distribute it internally.

For details, including an extensives set of bullets and suggestions coming out of the original research, see separate [“Briefing 1 – Baseline Key Messages”](add link to GH file)

#### 2: Onboarding package
During the research it was agreed that the project would benefit from a clearly defined onboarding package. The ask here is therefore rather straightforward: define a list of existing material that answers two basic questions: 

* If I want to learn about Baseline (and I am not a technical contributor) what should I look at, and in what order? 
* If I want to contribute, get involved, what should I do? 


For details, see separate document: [“Briefing 2 – Onboarding package"](add link to GH file)

#### 3: Marketing presentation
Baseline has a very solid marketing presentation which has been [posted in the Enablement Slack channel](https://ethereum-baseline.slack.com/files/UTXMY2B70/F01RCC2ADLH/baseline_protocol_overview.v05.pdf). As the project has been evolving, and also considering the work we have been doing on the messaging side, we recommend that it be updated and expanded. **The ask is to develop a new marketing presentation based on the old one and the new messaging** being developed as part of this framework. 

For details, see separate document:[“Briefing 3 - Baseline Marketing Presentation”](add link to GH file)

#### 4: Website
One of the things most often requested during the research was to update – or really build out – the project website at [www.baseline-protocol.org](www.baseline-protocol.org) to make it the main entry and reference point for newcomers or our non-technical audience. **The ask is to work with the Oasis team to gather requirements and provide a website spec.** A lot of the content will by its nature be based on other content we are developing, and for which the website will provide a home. 

For details, see separate document:[“Briefing 4 – Baseline Website”](add link to GH file)

#### 5: FAQ
Another frequently requested communication item that surfaced during the research was a good set of Frequently Asked Questions. **The ask is to work with the Community to develop such an FAQ, as well as put processes in place to keep it updated over time.**

For details, see separate document: [“Briefing 5 – Baseline FAQ”](add GH file link)

#### 6: Content index
One of the findings of the research was that, while there was a lot of excellent content already available, a lot of people, and newcomers in particular, were being overwhelmed. For this reason we are concentrating on things like a website, FAQs, onboarding package, in an attempt to provide a more accessible overview. That said, considering all that already exists, both on project-owned channels and on external ones, as well as what is likely to be generated as the project matures. The ask is to develop a content index for Baseline as well as processes to keep it updated over time. The most likely home for such an index would be the website.

For details, including a first draft index of existing content, see separate document: [“Briefing 6 – Baseline Content Index”](add link to GH file)

## Other content projects
A project of Baseline’s size and ambitions will need more than the core content mentioned above. Below is a list – by no means comprehensive – of some other collateral the project might consider:

* **Marketing white paper**: Non-technical white paper describing Baseline and its uses in some detail.
* **Case study template**: Having case studies will be very useful. Might be a good idea to make a template so that projects can easily document what they’ve done after they go online.
* **Solution provider index**: List of companies providing products and services around Baselining. 
* **Explainer videos**: Develop explainer videos covering the basic business messaging (these exist to some degree)
* **Full Baseline presentation deck/slide library**: We’ve created a briefing for updating the basic marketing presentation. It could also be useful to develop a more comprehensive slide library for use by anyone presenting Baseline at a conference or sales meeting.
* **Press kit/Media QnA**: Adapt materials to create a journalist-friendly introduction to Baseline, for PR purposes.
* **Media Watch**: Could be good to maintain
* **Start your own Baseline chapter starter kit**: As Baseline communities begin to be formed around the world (as for example has already happened in India), it might be a good idea to create a set of guidelines for how to start a chapter, how to promote it, etc.
* **Blog**: the Medium blog seems dormant, perhaps it would make sense to revive it. If we can find writers willing to post regularly, or a large stable willing to post occasionally, we could generate a nice content flow.
* **OpEd and other media**: Would be good to get Baseline representatives writing for the trade press and mainstream media if possible.

## Comms and Marketing Setup
It will likely come as a surprise to no one that governance and resources for the communications and marketing effort are a major challenge (see Problem 7 above). It is beyond the scope of this framework to specify a setup, but below we have put together some suggestions and observations based on the experience during the research phase. 

* **Formalise the setup, particularly governance**: It might make sense to have a more formal communications and marketing organisation, to the extent this is feasible. This would include formalising:
	   * **Governance**. Governance is particularly important: as mentioned above, it is easy in a large group of talented and experienced people, like that found in Baseline, to come up with lots of ideas and lots of content. It is rare for these ideas to be completely compatible with each other, or for there to be a clear answer for what is better, more effective, or more desirable. There needs to be a clear process for deciding, what will be done, by whom, in what way, and by when. This is equally true if the project relies on volunteer communications and marketing contributions, or has dedicated resources.
	   * **Communications and Marketing processes**. Processes, including signoff procedures if any (see next), should be defined to the extent possible, and more importantly clearly communicated. Particularly when working with volunteer contributors, it should be easy for people to understand how to contribute and what the processes and parameters are.
	   * **Legal and regulatory**. To the extent not already done, the project should be sure it has taken into account any and all legal or compliance requirements for the content it produces and uses. If there is a need for formal signoff for content, this should be defined.
* **Have clear ownership of comms and marketing collateral:** Particularly when working with volunteers, and for reasons similar to those in the previous bullet, the project will be well served by ensuring there are individual owners for each major piece of communications or marketing collateral. This is to promote accountability and help ensure work, once agreed, gets done. The role and responsibility of a document owner should be clearly defined. 
* **Consider hiring, perhaps by means of a sponsor**: For the above reasons, and if there is funding, the project should examine the feasibility of hiring staff for communications and marketing support. One model that could work well under the current setup is to hire a more junior person to provide operational support, while leaving the governance and oversight to the Outreach team. As one of the interviewees said, it could make sense for – and be in the interest of – some of the project sponsors to get together and fund such a position.
* **Make use of grants and bounties**: The grant process is a great way to encourage people to contribute content. One way to do this is to post briefings (like the ones supplied in this document) and suggest that people apply for grants to do the work. 
* **Make a concerted community push**: The project will also be well served by encouraging volunteers to contribute. Best results are likely to be had if you provide clear frameworks (like this one hopes to be) and specs, but also if you make a clear case for why it might be a good idea to contribute (help the project, get your name associated with Baseline, etc.). There are talking points for community outreach being developed as part of the key messages project.

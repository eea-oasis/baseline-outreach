## Briefing 1 – Baseline Key Messages


The project should agree on some basic messaging/marketing language and its target personas. This would not be distributed externally, but rather be used internally to inform any other basic messaging. We recommend the following:

* Boilerplate language
    *  Tagline
    * 1 sentence
    * 1 paragraph
    * 1 page
* Detailed Key Messages
* Audience/persona profiles


We have already started this work, so **the ask is for someone to take ownership of the below content and bring it to a final form.**

## Personas: Audiences and stakeholders
In the course of the research we began a list of personas that should be addressed by the messaging. We differentiate between audiences (direct addressees) and stakeholders (other communications-relevant parties). This list should be validated and to the extent possible the persona profiles fleshed out, in particular by identifying why the particular persona is important and what kind of messaging would be appropriate for them. This can be useful in creating targeted marketing material, PR and related comms.

### Audiences
#### Projects / Users / Decision makers
The main audience we are targeting here are potential projects and users of Baseline, and in particular decision makers. Among these are: 

* **C-Suite:** in particular CEO, CIO or CISOs (CISOs have been flagged as a potentially very important target group). Other C-Suite audiences that were flagged as of interest were:
   * **Chief Risk Officers**: CROs touch every department to look at the quantitative and qualitative risks. They touch every aspect of an enterprise, and so have insight into all the various enterprises processes, and so understand the needs as well as risks. This is a largely unapproached group and could be of Risk managers are a big thing that is largely unpacked. They can be approached by referencing various processes that Baseline might improve, with a focus on risk mitigation.
   * **The Controller or CFO**: This role also has an overview is an accountant, a numbers person. That is a good thing. They are the ones that have at least the authority to release the funds for this. 
* **Functional roles**: We should look at the feasibility of targeting functional roles like product managers, supply chain responsible, or logistics people as well, with an eye to generating interest in Baseline and then supporting these people internally with educational and marketing material so that they can make the case for Baseline internally within their organisations.
* **Organisations**: While not strictly personas, the project might want to think about a list of large enterprises and organisations to target. It could be a useful exercise to build this out and perhaps create a contact list to go with it.

#### Contributors
The project relies on a wide variety of contributors. They will need both reasons to contribute and clear information on how to contribute. So outreach, education and governance themes are quite pertinent here. Contributor personas include but are not limited to:

* Coders
* Standards writers
* Technical writers
* Communicators/Marketers
* Potential members

#### Journalists
While this is really the domain of PR, there should be a focus on journalists. One useful exercise might be to identify journalists working on enterprise topics, as well as in key trade publications.


## Baseline Boilerplate
Below are some versions of draft Boilerplate copy for standard descriptions. It is based on the tagline, 1 sentence, 1 paragraph and 1 page model. These texts have been **reviewed once by the Outreach team, but they are not final. These need to be agreed and finalised.**

### Tagline
Secure, decentralised, open-source enterprise collaboration

*Variant:*

A new substrate for commerce

### One sentence
The Baseline Protocol is an open source project developing a new standard and set of tools to provide decentralised, secure, enterprise-grade collaboration across large business networks.

*Variants:*

Baseline is a set of tools and standards on how to use blockchain technology to transform your business processes and operate on a blockchain.

Baseline allows for strictly deterministic business processes in zero knowledge.

### One paragraph
Our existing single paragraph, which is quite good:

The Baseline Protocol is an open source initiative that combines advances in cryptography, messaging, and blockchain to deliver secure and private business processes at low cost via the public Ethereum Mainnet. The protocol will enable confidential and complex collaboration between enterprises without leaving any sensitive data on-chain.”

*An alternative, somewhat longer variant:*

Baseline is a method to synchronise information inside different systems of record between different organisations without revealing that information. Being able to do this solves some of the biggest problems facing companies that want to collaborate but are worried about the security of their data and/or the expense of building new collaboration infrastructures or relying on third party platforms. It combines highly advanced cryptography, secure messaging and the blockchain to create mathematical proofs that collaborators on a workflow share the same information in their systems of record without the actual data ever leaving those systems, and with no need to alter those systems of record or invest in expensive new infrastructure. It is safer, cheaper, and easier-to-implement and deploy than most other methods of synchronising information and workflows among multiple parties. With Baseline, you can virtually eliminate your back office reconciliation costs, reduce your cycle times to mere minutes, and maintain consistent recordkeeping in multiparty/counterparty workflows, all without sacrificing your security profile or data privacy compliance. Furthermore, you can do this with your existing systems of record and without a significant capital investment.

### One page
The one pager attempts to summarise the basic messaging framework: problem statement, solution statement, use cases, advantages, project/governance, community, find out more.

Today’s supply chains and business networks are growing larger, more dynamic, and more interconnected. Often involving large numbers of participants with various levels of technical sophistication, they can be difficult to manage, especially in environments of continuous change. Enterprises are challenged to reap the advantages of interconnectivity and collaboration, including the commercial value inherent in the overall network-level flow of information, while at the same time protecting their valuable data and business secrets. Despite all our advances in communications and information technology, businesses have been unable to automate shared processes to the degree that many would like, stymied by data security concerns and lack of a broad-based, common collaboration platform that can square the circle between transparency and privacy.

The Baseline Protocol provides a solution. An open source initiative that combines advances in cryptography, messaging, and blockchain to deliver secure and private business processes at low cost via the public Ethereum Mainnet, the protocol enables confidential and complex collaboration between enterprises without leaving any sensitive data on-chain. It is not a product, but rather a method to synchronise information inside different systems of record between different organisations without actually revealing that information. Being able to do this solves some of the biggest problems facing companies that want to collaborate but are worried about the security of their data and/or the expense of building new collaboration infrastructures or relying on third party platforms. It combines highly advanced cryptography, secure messaging and the blockchain to create mathematical proofs that collaborators on a workflow or all have the same information in their systems of record without the actual data ever leaving those systems, and with no need to alter those systems of record or invest in expensive new infrastructure. It is safer, cheaper, and easier-to-implement and deploy than most other methods of synchronising information and workflows among multiple parties.

Baseline can be applied to almost any business process involving multiple stakeholders where trust, security, interoperability, ease of access and low cost are important. It is particularly well suited to simplifying complex supply chain and procurement workflows, automating business processes in large business networks with heterogeneous stakeholders, preventing fraud, and in helping dramatically reduce the cost of reconciliation and dispute resolution. With a native tokenisation capabilities, the Baseline Protocol has interesting applications in trade and supply chain finance as well as decentralised finance (Enterprise DeFi). 

As an open source project sponsored by some of the biggest names in enterprise collaboration and blockchain, but open to any and all who want to contribute or participate, Baseline is a developing standard and set of design patterns. It offers high transparency, low cost, no vendor lock-in, and the ability to easily adapt to a myriad of business use cases. Designed to integrate with legacy systems of record, Baseline requires little to no investment to use, and no change to existing infrastructure. By leveraging the public blockchain mainnet as middleware, enterprises can benefit from a reliable, always on, open infrastructure that operates on a pay-per-use principle. With Baseline, no data ever leaves the enterprise. Instead, the protocol provides a means for business collaborators to easily build verified workgroups, agreed on shared workflows, and then share cryptographic proofs that all parties' systems of record are in sync. While these proofs are time stamped and secured on the public blockchain, they do not reveal any sensitive data, not even to the most sophisticated analysis algorithms.

Baseline is an OASIS open source project. To learn more about Baseline, including how your organisation can get involved, visit [https://www.baseline-protocol.org/](https://www.baseline-protocol.org/) 


**Note:** Jan Brezina had this comment on the above:  @Tom Lyons - what audience are we targeting ? if this is for technical audience and we are selling technology, I think it makes sense. But if we are targeting business people, it means they have problem and we have a solution, I think we should be less technical and target more the problem statement/business reason. As EY we have this vision: "Blockchains will do for networks of enterprises and business ecosystems what enterprise resource planning (ERP) did for the single company." And even though I have not created it, I like it because it simply says what we are trying to do. They all know what an ERP is and which problem it is solving, so it's easy for them to relate to it and get a sense of what we can do for them. I think the baseline statement can be a little bit more specific and I like the end of your statement "The protocol will enable confidential and complex collaboration between enterprises without leaving any sensitive data on-chain.” I am just not sure about the beginning “The Baseline Protocol is an open source initiative that combines advances in cryptography, messaging, and blockchain to deliver secure and private business processes at low cost via the public Ethereum Mainnet"


## Messaging
To keep the messaging consistent, it makes sense to work out 

### Basic messaging structure
During the research we agreed on the following general set of themes for the messaging:

* **Problem statement - why would you need Baseline**: what are the problems that Baseline addresses. This should be detailed to show that the project understands the pain points of a typical user.
* **Solution statement - what is Baseline/Baselining and how does it work**: Easy to grasp, non-technical but also non-detailed descriptions of what Baseline is and, to an extent, how it works. 
* **Use cases**: descriptions of use cases in all shapes and forms: meta-level (basic business issues), sector specific, use cases already in production, theoretical use case scenarios, etc.
* **Advantages/talking points/proof points**: any and everything that can be used to differentiate Baseline and make the case of its efficacy/utility. We have provided a sample list of these below.
* **Project and Governance**: How Baseline is being built, by whom, and how it is governed. 
* **Community and Contribution**: How people can contribute to Baseline, and why they would want to.
* **Information resources**: indices, links, etc. pointing people to more information; onboarding packages and the like.

## Key Messages
Below we’ve put together some recommendations and thoughts for anyone working on the above themes. These came out of the work but are not comprehensive.

### Problem statement - why would you need Baseline?
Some of the pain points for enterprises for which a Baseline solution might be appropriate include:

* **Complexity of collaboration on business processes**: Supply chains and many types of business ecosystems are highly complex, with lots of stakeholders/participants, various levels of sophistication/digitisation, various levels of involvement, and different needs for sharing and shielding information. Thanks to globalisation, it is not what it was even 10 years ago. Business networks are getting larger, faster, more intertwined. They are increasingly difficult and costly to manage, especially in dynamic ways (for example easily adding and removing partners) while keeping data and business secrets secure.
* **Value in network-level data versus need to protect proprietary data and business secrets**: There is a great deal of commercial value in a business network from aggregated/network level data flows. Yet businesses understandably do not want to reveal information that could compromise their competitive advantage, and they also have regulatory obligations to protect customer and other data. 
* **Lack of Business Process Automation**: Despite all our advances in communications and information technology, businesses have been unable to automate processes as much as they would like or that is theoretically possible. Issues include the complexity mentioned above, data and platform silos, lack of trust, lack of common business workflow modelling platforma, lack of common automation platforma.
* **General friction and cost of collaboration**: Data silos, trust issues and complexity create a great deal of friction when it comes to large-scale business collaboration. Manual processes, which still exist in many cases, make reconciliation difficult and expensive, and introduce potential for error. Companies that have already invested heavily in their own systems are not keen on changing their existing infrastructure to accommodate a business network. 
* **Security versus the advantages of open platforms**: Businesses in large networks need to protect proprietary data. Hence a great reluctance to share in open platforms. Yet open platforms can provide great advantages for large business networks in terms of trust and interoperability. Enterprises are therefore looking for ways to square this circle.

### Solution statement - what is Baseline/Baselining and how does it work?

To promote Baseline, it is important to be able to describe what Baseline is and how it works in simple language geared towards business decision makers and users. We have attempted to do this in the Boilerplate above. But we will need to do more to develop standard ways to describe the technology. This has already been done in existing presentations and other material, above all in various videos. The recommendation here is to keep refining this to make it as clear as non-technical as possible, and end up with some sort of standard language or talking points. To reiterate: we already have excellent technical resources, so the idea is to keep working on the plain-language variants. **Below are a set of bullets culled from various existing materials and intended to get the ball rolling on this task. This may be one of the more challenging parts of this project.**

* **How the Baseline process works (this should be built out and made more tangible)**:
   * Create a workgroup: like Slack, invite people in. They get an ETH address (not for signing) which serves like a DID
   * Counterparties securely share/sign their commitments (agreements, purchase order, business logic, price, whatever) directly between each other, all parties sign it. Signatures are recorded on the blockchain.
   * As processes go on, zero knowledge circuits generate proofs that each party conforms to the process/has the same information along the workflow.
   * Smart contracts on the blockchain help ensure this happens this way.
* **Components of Baseline (from EY May 21 presentation)**
	* Zero knowledge circuits
	* P2P Messaging
	* Internal Messaging
	* Merkle Tree Manager
* **Important considerations (from EY May 21 presentation)**
	* Security: enterprise data must never leave the enterprise. It is masked from everyone.
	* Data consistency: via state accumulators and Merkle trees
	* Mainnet: smart contracts to verify data consistency while leaving data private; extensible to changing privacy techniques (future proof)
	* Scalability: Extend privacy state to other entities; track proof as they change state.
* **Components 2 (from EY May 21 Presentation)**
	* API
	* Contracts
	* Messaging
	* Persistence
	* Privacy

### Use cases/Business requirements
Use cases will be a key element to not just making the case for Baseline, but explaining how it works (as people can in effect “see it in action”). Below are some lists of business requirements and use cases that were surfaced during the research:

#### Requirements (met by Baseline - as per Presentation05)
* Business process automation between multiple partners (potentially very large number)
* Controlled/shielded access/awareness of steps in the business processes from selected partners
* Accommodate networks with relatively high levels of subject matter experts/low volume participants (participants do not need to invest heavily)
* Need for trust/proof in records to mediate disputes among counterparties.
* Desire to reduce up-front capital expenditure
* Desire to easily integrate new workflows/participants over time
* Desire to not have to sunset existing systems of record
* Desire to verifiably enforce adherence to agreed-upon workflows and enforce consistency among all parties

#### Meta use cases/Canonical use cases
A “meta use case” is a basic business use case that can be applied to different sectors. It represents base-level business problems:

* Reconciliation
* Business process automation
* Trade and supply chain finance
* Dispute resolution
* Audit
* Fraud prevention
* Procurement
* Supply Chain
* Track and trace
* Enterprise DeFi/Tokenisation

#### Sector-specific use cases
It would be useful to collect use cases in specific sectors too. This will grab attention from representatives of those sectors. Below a very partial list, we can fill it in.

* Gaming
* Healthcare
* Manufacturing
* IoT security
* *We should add more…* 

#### Use case scenarios
It can be equally useful to describe scenarios from a user perspective. These were suggested by Marc Haddle (available in detail in a separate document):

* Warrant administration
* Medical billing intake
* Care & Benefits coordination
* Clinical trial administration
* *We should add more…*


Marc Haddle suggested this “MadLibs” style form to surface scenarios:

People/Role ____, ____, and ____ in companies ____, ____, and ____ have a workflow to accomplish ____ by performing worksteps ____, ____, and ____.Workstep ____ involves a record that must be shared and be the same between ____, ____, and ____.  That record has fields for data ____.  Later, a subsequent Workstep requires that data from the previous record in order to calculate new fields ____.That first shared record (and in particular the data needed for the subsequent workstep) turns out not to be consistent between the parties about ____% of the time, and when that happens, ____ happens about ____% of the time. When that happens, ____, ____, and ____ are the bad bad things that result.The companies each have different ways they hedge against this potentially happening, including ____, ____, and ____). And that hedging costs them roughly ____ much a year.

#### In production/PoC use cases
It will be very useful for the project to collect as many real use cases as possible and document these. As part of this, it might be useful to prepare some sort of use case template, so as projects begin to go live, people can easily document them. Some early projects that might be profiled are:

* CONA
* ServiceNow
* Frauenhofer (IoT)

### Advantages/Proof points
It will be important to focus strongly on the advantages of Baseline. Below a number of bullets that were surfaced during the research:

* **Open Source**: transparency, no vendor lock-in, free to use, contribute to the development, easy/free to customise.
* **Standard/Approach, not a product**: it is a set of tools and best practices to follow, not something you have to buy.
* **Provides secure synchronisation of business data without revealing data**: squares the circle between transparency and privacy.
* **Large-group friendly**: easy to create small or large networks of known participants (workgroups), easy to onboard large but also, crucially, smaller entities (no need for sophisticated IT). Easy to integrate for example SMEs. 
* **Leverage existing ecosystems**: No need to build new ecosystems, as with many private blockchains. Rather you can leverage existing ecosystems, simply by inviting to workgroups.
* **Integrates with legacy systems/no need to change**: designed to integrate with legacy systems of record, SAP, MS, Oracle, Google Sheets, Splunk, etc. etc. No need to touch, sunset, revise or do anything with existing infrastructure/investment.
* **Low investment and running cost/easy to implement**: relatively low initial investment to implement, pay-per-use via Mainnet.
* **Secure/Private**: no enterprise data ever leaves an organisation’s IT systems. You are sharing proofs, not actual information. Data, business processes, transactions are shielded from even the most sophisticated online/on-chain data analytics. Business secrets are safe.
* **Advantages of Mainnet/Shared public infrastructure**: public infrastructure (public blockchain) is always on, available to all, pay-per-use. No major investment here either. Mainnet as public middleware.
* **Advantages/Right use of public blockchain**: Public blockchain seen as a common frame of reference to provide ordering and hash management to traditional systems of record, allowing multiple systems in different companies to enforce data consistency and workflow integrity without taxing blockchain throughput or risking data breaches. The advantages of public blockchain without the performance and data security disadvantages.
* **Cost reduction on business collaboration**: provable (?) ROI through cost reduction, improvement of business process KPIs. Provable low per transaction costs (? - we need examples)
* **Advantages over private blockchain**: private blockchains have not proven suitable for large-scale enterprise use cases for various reasons [these are??: no need to build consortia, better privacy/more secure, more scalable (larger groups/networks)]. Save face on your failed Fabric project. 
* **New substrate for commerce/obviates need for much IT infrastructure**: use of standard tools, Mainnet, etc. provides out-of-the-box, secure, decentralised, open source collaboration methodology.
* **Catalyses digitisation and business process automation**: Easy way to push digitisation and automation of processes, as it is an open source, relatively inexpensive, shared approach. Easy path to bring suppliers and other parties onboard on a shared business network.
* **Project backed by serious players in Enterprise software and blockchain**: EY, Microsoft, ConsenSys, et. al. [Use full list]
* **Real-world adoption within the first year**: CONA, Service Now, successful reference implementations usable in real-world cases: BRI1, BRI2, Radish34. [Interest expressed publicly by: ????]
* **Already successful service providers**: Provide/Unibright, who else? Already making money with this.
* **Rapid growth of community**: Number of contributors, members, maintainers, etc.

### How it is being built/Governance
We will want to provide some clear information on how Baseline is being built and the project is being governed. This is already covered quite nicely in the Gitdocs, so this aspect of the project may be more about re-packaging that for other channels, for example the website or a brochure. Below are some bullets that might also be useful for messaging around Baseline governance.

#### About the Baseline project
* Open source project: not everyone we are targeting will really understand what open source is and how it works. Might be good to have some explainers. Ditto Oasis.
* Advantages of open source
* Making it crystal clear that Baseline is about writing a standard/set of design patterns = NOT a product
* Anyone can join, contribute

#### Project governance
* Sponsors: who are they, what do they do? Any undue influence (this will be asked)
* Explaining the various roles and responsibilities:
  * Contributors
	  * Technical
	  * Specifications
	  * Members
	  * Maintainers
  * Committees
	  * Project Governance Board
	  * TSC
	  * SSC
* Governance documentation
* Calendar: Right now the calendar is only available via Github. Might be good to have a more public-facing one.

### Who is involved/Community
Again, the Gitdocs covers the community pretty well, but we can always work to bring more visibility to membership. Below is some content copied over from Gitdocs.

#### Community statistics
The Baseline Protocol initiative was announced on March 4, 2020 and launched as an OASIS open source project. Governed by the Ethereum OASIS Project Governing Board under the OASIS Open Projects Program.

Technical Steering Committee Members: 11

Community participants: 1800+

Official sponsors: 11 (as off June 2021):
* Accenture
* Chainlink
* ConsenSys
* Enterprise Ethereum Alliance
* Ethereum Foundation
* Provide
* Nethermind
* Morpheus Network
* Splunk
* Unibright

#### Roadmap
The project roadmap will likely be of high interest to a lot of people. Right now there is a technical roadmap on Github. It would be a good idea to develop a public-facing, high level roadmap that can be easily accessed online.

### How can people get involved, and why they should
Another theme that will be important is encouraging people to get involved. Because Baseline is an enterprise-oriented project, we will need a good set of talking points/motivations. Below are some bullets on this theme. 

#### How to get involved
* Make it clear that anyone can join, anyone can contribute
* These typically be potential users, or potential service provider
* Simply join community and get going
* Use our onboarding process (tbd)

#### Why to get involved
* You can make money by providing Baseline-conform products and services
    * Licensing fees
    * Transaction fees
    * Tokenise things
* You can help shape an important new technology that will help your organisation save money and operate more efficiently.
